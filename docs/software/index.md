!!! warning "Feature Requests"
All feature requests should be submitted prior to the scheduled release day of the prior month.  For example, for a feature request to be considered for the September 2016 release, it should be submitted to the [JIRA](feedback) tracker before the August release day `2016/08/17`.  This will allow the software engineers sufficient time to plan and execute the upcoming activities.
